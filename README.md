## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- **CSS Grid** layout
- Flexbox (for internal card content)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me:

- Practice **CSS Grid** for building multi-column layouts that adjust across screen sizes.
- Create consistent **spacing and alignment** using `gap`, `grid-template-areas`, and `auto-fit`.
- Understand how to build a clean **visual hierarchy** using background colors and font weights.
- Work with **semantic HTML5 tags** for better accessibility and structure.

### Continued development

Iâ€™d like to explore:

- Adding **entry animations** for cards on scroll using CSS or JavaScript.
- Creating a utility-first CSS system to reuse spacing and color tokens.
